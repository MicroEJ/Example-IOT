# Overview

This example shows how to setup a Rest Server.

This server provides a simple HTML page which shows some simulated information about the device (uptime, java heap usage, thread).

# Requirements

* [MICROEJ SDK 6](https://docs.microej.com/en/latest/SDK6UserGuide/index.html).
* A [VEE Port](https://github.com/MicroEJ/?q=VEEPort&type=all&language=&sort=) that contains:
    * EDC-1.3 or higher
    * BON-1.4 or higher
    * NET-1.1 or higher

This example has been tested on:

- IntelliJ IDEA with MicroEJ plugin for IntelliJ IDEA ``1.1.0``.
- [NXP i.MX RT1170 VEE Port 3.0.0](https://github.com/MicroEJ/nxp-vee-imxrt1170-evk/tree/NXPVEE-MIMXRT1170-EVK-3.0.0).

# Usage

Follow [MICROEJ SDK 6 Installation Guide](https://docs.microej.com/en/latest/SDK6UserGuide/install.html) to setup the SDK.

By default, the sample will use the
[NXP i.MX RT1170 VEE Port 3.0.0](https://github.com/MicroEJ/nxp-vee-imxrt1170-evk/tree/NXPVEE-MIMXRT1170-EVK-3.0.0).
The sample retrieves the VEE Port as a [module](https://docs.microej.com/en/latest/SDK6UserGuide/selectVeePort.html#using-a-module-dependency).

Refer to the [Select a VEE Port](https://docs.microej.com/en/latest/SDK6UserGuide/selectVeePort.html)
documentation to use another VEE Port in your project.

## Run on Simulator

Run the following command in your IDE
(or click the ``Play`` button next to the line
below when opening this README in IntelliJ IDEA):

`./gradlew :dynamic-restserver:runOnSimulator`

Alternative ways to run in simulation are described in the [Run on Simulator](https://docs.microej.com/en/latest/SDK6UserGuide/runOnSimulator.html) documentation.

## Run on Device

Complete the [Getting Started for NXP i.MX RT1170 Evaluation Kit](https://docs.microej.com/en/latest/SDK6UserGuide/gettingStartedIMXRT1170.html)
to make sure your environment is fully setup.

If you are using another VEE Port, make sure to properly setup the VEE Port environment
before going further. Refer to the dedicated VEE Port README or Getting Started for more information.

Run the following command in your IDE
(or click the ``Play`` button next to the line
below when opening this README in IntelliJ IDEA):

`./gradlew :dynamic-restserver:runOnDevice`

Alternative ways to run on device are described in the [Run on Device](https://docs.microej.com/en/latest/SDK6UserGuide/runOnDevice.html) documentation.

## Expected Behavior

Once the REST Server is running:
- If you are running the application in simulation you should be able to access it through a web browser using the url http://localhost:8080.
- If you are running the application on a board you should be able to access it through a web browser using the board's local ip address: http://**board-ip**:8080.
  You should get on a simple html page which shows some simulated information about the board (uptime, java heap usage, thread).

## Going further

The source code is provided as is for educative purpose, to reduce the embedded constraint, it is recommended to:
- Minify then compress the resources with gz and use a GzipResourceEndpoint.
- Unify the resources in a single HTML page to avoid 3 connections.

# Dependencies

The dependencies defined in [build.gradle.kts](build.gradle.kts)
are configured in [libs.versions.toml](../gradle/libs.versions.toml).

_All dependencies are retrieved transitively by Gradle._

# Source

N/A

# Restrictions

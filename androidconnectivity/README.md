# Overview

This example shows how to use the Connectivity Manager.

The Connectivity Manager allows to know the state of the network connectivity.

# Requirements

* [MICROEJ SDK 6](https://docs.microej.com/en/latest/SDK6UserGuide/index.html).
* A [VEE Port](https://github.com/MicroEJ/?q=VEEPort&type=all&language=&sort=) that contains:
    * EDC-1.3 or higher
    * NET-1.1 or higher

This example has been tested on:

- IntelliJ IDEA with MicroEJ plugin for IntelliJ IDEA ``1.1.0``.
- [NXP i.MX RT1170 VEE Port 3.0.0](https://github.com/MicroEJ/nxp-vee-imxrt1170-evk/tree/NXPVEE-MIMXRT1170-EVK-3.0.0).

# Usage

Follow [MICROEJ SDK 6 Installation Guide](https://docs.microej.com/en/latest/SDK6UserGuide/install.html) to setup the SDK.

By default, the sample will use the
[NXP i.MX RT1170 VEE Port 3.0.0](https://github.com/MicroEJ/nxp-vee-imxrt1170-evk/tree/NXPVEE-MIMXRT1170-EVK-3.0.0).
The sample retrieves the VEE Port as a [module](https://docs.microej.com/en/latest/SDK6UserGuide/selectVeePort.html#using-a-module-dependency).

Refer to the [Select a VEE Port](https://docs.microej.com/en/latest/SDK6UserGuide/selectVeePort.html) 
documentation to use another VEE Port in your project.

## Run on Simulator

Run the following command in your IDE
(or click the ``Play`` button next to the line
below when opening this README in IntelliJ IDEA):

`./gradlew :androidconnectivity:runOnSimulator`

Alternative ways to run in simulation are described in the [Run on Simulator](https://docs.microej.com/en/latest/SDK6UserGuide/runOnSimulator.html) documentation.

## Run on Device

Complete the [Getting Started for NXP i.MX RT1170 Evaluation Kit](https://docs.microej.com/en/latest/SDK6UserGuide/gettingStartedIMXRT1170.html)
to make sure your environment is fully setup.

If you are using another VEE Port, make sure to properly setup the VEE Port environment
before going further. Refer to the dedicated VEE Port README or Getting Started for more information.

Run the following command in your IDE
(or click the ``Play`` button next to the line
below when opening this README in IntelliJ IDEA):

`./gradlew :androidconnectivity:runOnDevice`

Alternative ways to run on device are described in the [Run on Device](https://docs.microej.com/en/latest/SDK6UserGuide/runOnDevice.html) documentation.

## Multi-Sandbox Considerations

In a Multi-Sandbox context, the network callback registered at the application startup should be unregistered when the application stops.

Find below an implementation example:
```java
	@Override
	public void stop() {
		MyConnectivityExample connectivityExample = this.connectivityExample;
		this.connectivityExample = null;
		ConnectivityManager connectivityManager = ServiceFactory
				.getService(ConnectivityManager.class);
		if (connectivityExample != null && connectivityManager != null) {
			connectivityManager.unregisterNetworkCallback(connectivityExample);
		}
	}
```

## Expected Behavior

Once the application is connected to the internet,
the following traces should be observed in the console:

```
android connectivity example INFO: Network is lost.
android connectivity example INFO: Connected to the internet = false
android connectivity example INFO: Network is available.
android connectivity example INFO: Connected to the internet = true
```

# Dependencies

The dependencies defined in [build.gradle.kts](build.gradle.kts)
are configured in [libs.versions.toml](../gradle/libs.versions.toml).

_All dependencies are retrieved transitively by Gradle._
